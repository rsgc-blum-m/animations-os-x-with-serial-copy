\f0\fs24 \cf0 My code uses a potentiometer to control the x domain of a line that acts as a hand of a metronome. The input from the potentiometer is taken by writing an analog read from an Arduino to the serial monitor, which is then taken by Swift and incorporated into the sketch. By turning the potentiometer, the boundary will increase (slower bpm) or decrease (faster bpm). Also, using some unit circle trigonometry the y value of the line will arch much like a real life metronome.}
